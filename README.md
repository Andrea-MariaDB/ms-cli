### Code formatting

This project uses [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting.
To format the code, run `black .`. You might need to add your python scripts
directory to your path. For me, this was done with:

```
set PATH=%PATH%;%localappdata%\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.7_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python37\Scripts
```
